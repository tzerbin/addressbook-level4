== Introduction

CelebManager is a computer software designed to help celebrity managers *to manage their celebrities' schedules*.
It is *optimized for managers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you require a versatile application that has the
feature of *managing persons, organising schedules, emailing (Coming in v2.0) and trip planning*. You are at the right
place as CelebManager would be the best platform for you, with its integration of address book, calendar and visual maps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Follow this series of steps to have CelebManager quickly up and running on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer. The link to the latest version of Java
can be found
https://java.com/en/download/[here].
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `CelebManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CelebManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The interface should appear in a few seconds.
+
The image below (Figure 1) shows the interface of CelebManager after the first launch.
+
.Interface of CelebManager upon the first launch
image::Ui_UserGuide.jpg[width="790"]
+
CelebManager's interface comprises of 5 panels: `CommandBox` (top), `ResultDisplay` (right below `CommandBox`),
`PersonListPanel` (left), `MapPanel` (bottom left), and `CalendarPanel` (bottom right), as labelled in the figure below.
Note that the labelling is for illustration purpose and will not appear in the actual interface.
+
.Interface of CelebManager with labels
image::Ui_labelled_UserGuide.jpg[width="790"]
+
`CommandBox` is for you to enter the commands. +
`ResultsDisplay` shows the execution result of the command entered in `CommandBox`. +
`PersonListPanel` displays the details of each person stored in CelebManager. There are some persons created to
provide you a quick view of how each person looks like in `PersonListPanel`. You can follow this guide to clear these
persons in the later part. +
`MapPanel` provides you a map view. +
`CalendarPanel` provides you a calendar view of the appointments stored in CelebManager. +
These panel names will be used to help explain the functionality of different commands.
+
.  Type `help` in `CommandBox` and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. A help window should be opened.
+
[TIP]
Refer to <<Features>> for details of all commands available in CelebManager and their example usage.

[[Features]]
== Features

For each of the command in CelebManager, their formats follow some general patterns as mentioned in the text box below.

====
*Command Format*

* All commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command, e.g. to add a contact to CelebManager,
you can type either `add n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi` or `a n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you, e.g. in `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`,
`NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `ADDRESS`, and `TAG` are parameters which can be used as
`add n/John Doe p/123456 e/john@gmail.com a/Clementi`.
* Items in square brackets are optional, e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order, e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
acceptable.
====

====
*Precaution*

* Refrain from clicking inside the calendar at all times, except for scrolling up and down using the scroll bar.
This bug will be fixed in v2.0.
* Commands that modify the persons and appointments stored in CelebManager (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `undo`, `redo`,
`addAppointment`, `deleteAppointment`, `editAppointment` etc) must be performed in combined calendar view unless
specified otherwise. +
Information about combined calendar view can be found in +
<<Changing to view the combined calendar: `viewCombinedCalendar` [Since v1.3]>>.

* `viewDate` +
Changes the base date of calendar to current date and displays the calendar by day for current date. +

[TIP]
====
Change in base date allows you to view calendar for different weeks and months.
For example, after `viewDate 03-05-2018`, you can type `viewCalendarBy week` - which will show you the
calendar for the first week of May of 2018, or `viewCalendarBy month` - which will show you the calendar
for May of 2018.

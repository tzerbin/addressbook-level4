== PROJECT: CelebManager

---

== Overview

CelebManager is a software application that aims to allow celebrity managers to maintain schedule of celebrities under them. CelebManager is optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual feedback.

In this software, the users will be able to:

.   Manage contacts
.	Manage appointments
.	Manage calendars
.	Plan efficient routes

The aim of the project portfolio is to show my contribution towards the development of CelebManager. This includes features implemented and contributions made to the user and developer guide.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to show location in map*
** What it does: Allow the celebrity manager to have a view of the exact location in a map. Notify celebrity manager if a location cannot be found on the map.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the celebrity manager to be familiar with the location.
 This is important as they are responsible of ensuring that their celebrities reaches the correct location for their appointment.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required integration of the new map interface with existing CelebManager interface. The implementation was challenging as it require a clear understanding of the external libraries used and its integration with the existing structure.
** Credits: Third party library used, which are `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to estimate route, distance and travel time between two location by driving in map*
** What it does: Allow the celebrity manager to have a view of the best route by driving between two location in a map. Provides information of estimated distance and time of travel by driving between two location. Notifies the celebrity manager if two location cannot be reached by driving.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the celebrity manager to find the best travel route between two location.
 This is important as they are responsible of chauffeuring their celebrities for their appointment.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to other command implementation. The implementation also required the integration of third party libraries with existing code structure.
** Credits: Third party library used, which are `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.


* *Minor enhancement*: added a View Appointment command which allow the celebrity manager to view a specific appointment details.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are some key sections I have contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Map Features

Map features allow you to interact with Google Map in `MapPanel` located at the bottom left of CelebManager.
The figure below shows the default state of `MapPanel`.

.Default state of `MapPanel`
image::BeforeInputMap.png[width="400"]

Whenever a new valid or invalid command belonging to map features is executed, any existing route or location marker will be removed.

==== Click inside the map [Since v1.3]

Google Map in `MapPanel` supports mouse clicking. You can: +
****
* Click the Map or Satellite button to toggle between road map or satellite view.
* Click the `+` to zoom in and `-` button to zoom out.
* Click, hold and move the mouse cursor to shift the current view of the map.
****

[NOTE]
Do not click the `Google` logo or `Terms of Use` button.
Clicking these two things triggers a bug which we plan to fix in `v2.0`.

=== ShowLocation Feature
==== Current Implementation

The ShowLocation mechanism is facilitated by the `ShowLocationCommand`, which resides inside `Logic`. It supports the viewing of location
in the `MapPanel` by updating the state of the `MapPanel`. This is done by re-centering the `MapPanel` to the latitude and longitude of the
location and identifying it with a location marker. This command inherits from `Command` so it *does not support the undo/redo feature*.

The following figure shows the marker that is used to identify the location in the `MapPanel`:

.Location marker
image::LocationMarker.png[width="50"]

The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for `ShowLocationCommand`:

.Inheritance diagram for `Command`
image::ShowLocationLogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width=""]

As you can see from the diagram, `ShowLocationCommand` inherits from the Command class and is not part of the Undoable Command.
Similar to the other commands like `FindCommand` *it will not be identified by the undo/redo feature*.

This command does not use the `Person` `Address` model to search for a specific location, it uses the `MapAddress` model. This is due to
 the difference in address specification details as the `Address` model is too specific for the command to work.
An example would be the details of unit number (e.g #11-111) which will result in an invalid command or inaccurate result.

The main difference between both model is shown below in the two code snippets.

The snippet code below shows the `Address` model:

[source,java]
----
public class Address {
    public static final String MESSAGE_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINTS =
                "Person addresses can take any values, and it should not be blank";
    /*
     * The first character of the address must not be a whitespace,
     * otherwise " " (a blank string) becomes a valid input.
     */
    public static final String ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[^\\s].*";
    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid person email.
     */
    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX);
    }
    ...
}
----

The snippet code below shows the `MapAddress` model:

[source,java]
----
public class MapAddress {
    public static final String MESSAGE_ADDRESS_MAP_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Address should be in location name, road name, block and road name or postal code format.\n"
                    + "Note:(Person address may not be valid as it consist of too many details like unit number)"
    /*
     * The first character of the address must not be a whitespace,
     * otherwise " " (a blank string) becomes a valid input.
     */
    public static final String ADDRESS_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[^\\s].*";
    ...
    /**
     * Returns true if a given string is a valid map address.
     */
    public static boolean isValidAddress(String test) {
        boolean isValid;
        Geocoding testAddress = new Geocoding();
        isValid = testAddress.checkIfAddressCanBeFound(test);
        return test.matches(ADDRESS_MAP_VALIDATION_REGEX) && isValid;
    }
    ...
}
----
The difference to note is the `isValidAddress` method, where `Address` only checks for *blank space* whereas `MapAddress`
checks for *blank space and the validity of location in google server*. Thus, making the command more restrictive to location,
 road, block name and postal code. Any details more than that, would result in a higher possibility of it being invalid or inaccurate.

This command uses the `GMAPSFX API` and  `Google Maps Web Services API` library which can be found http://rterp.github.io/GMapsFX/apidocs/[here] and https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.2.6/javadoc/[here] respectively.

* `GMAPSFX API` is used to create the `MapPanel` class which allows the
command to re-center and mark the new location which is then shown to the user.

* `Google Maps Web Services API` is used to create the
`Geocoding` class, which is used to convert `MapAddress` into latitude and longitude form (`LatLng`). The `LatLng` form
is then used by the command to find the exact location in the `MapPanel`.

Every new input of this command will remove the previous route or location marker and add the new marker into the map.

The snippet below shows the state of `MapPanel` before input of `ShowLocation` command:

.Default State of `MapPanel`
image::BeforeInputMap.png[width="400"]

After the input of "showLocation ma/Punggol" the `MapPanel` will be updated to the diagram below:

.State of `MapPanel` after `CommandInput`
image::AfterShowLocationInput.png[width="400"]

[NOTE]
Whenever an invalid `showLocation` command is done, any existing location marker or route will be removed from the map.

The following sequence diagram shows how the command works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `showLocationCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend `Command`
** Pros: Allows new developers to understand easily as the command is at the same abstraction level as other commands.
** Cons: Does not have the undo/redo feature as it is not part of `UndoableCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** Extend `UndoableCommand`
** Pros: Allows for command to have the undo/redo function.
** Cons: Requires more work that may not fit in with our timeline

===== Aspect: Use of address model
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `MapAddress`
** Pros: Allows the clear distinction of requirements between `MapAddress` and `Address` to avoid confusion
** Cons: Confusing as both `MapAddress` and `Address` model are quite similar.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Address`
** Pros: Reduces the amount of code/class in the project
** Cons: Confusing as different requirements for a single model. Lacks proper organisation.

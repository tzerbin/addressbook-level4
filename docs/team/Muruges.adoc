== PROJECT: CelebManager

---

== Overview

CelebManager is a software application that aims to allow celebrity managers to maintain schedule of celebrities under them. CelebManager is optimized for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for visual feedback.

In this software, the users should be able to:

.   Manage contacts
.	Manage appointments
.	Manage calendars
.	Plan efficient routes

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add appointments*
** What it does: Allows users to add new appointments into CelebManager. For each appointment, CelebManager takes in an appointment an appointment name field and other optional fields
such as the list of celebrities attending the appointment.
** Justification: This feature is in fact the main feature of the appointment, as we want to be able to manage the schedules of celebrities.
 The only way to do this would be to store and make corrections to these appointments that the celebrities are attending, which is what this feature allows for.
** Highlights: Creating this feature was something that was done over the entirety of the project, due to how we changed how we wanted to implement storing of the appointments.
 There was difficulties in implementation due to the fact that each appointment could only be associated with a single celebrities' calendar at a time. Hence, it was eventually decided that appointments will be stored
 centrally in a `StorageCalendar` and then cloned for each celebrity attending the appointment.
** Credits: A third party library called `CalendarFX` which can be found https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[here] was used to implement this feature.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add, edit and delete celebrities*
** What it does: Allow the celebrity manager to create, edit and delete celebrities. The existence of a celebrity will add a calendar to the UI.
** Justification: This feature works hand in hand with the previous enhancement mentioned. By creating a celebrity, a calendar is created. Now, when we create an appointment and
add a celebrity to the appointment, the appointment will display on the UI. This means that we are now able to view the appointments and effectively the schedule of the celebrity we are managing.
** Highlights: This enhancement was carried out through modifications to how the add, edit and delete commands worked. By recognizing a `celebrity` tag to indicate that the person is a celebrity,
the add and edit commands now create a calendar for the added or modified celebrity. There were a lot of difficulties as we had to make sure the celebrities
were synchronized with the calendars even when the commands were undoed or redoed, as add, edit and delete are meant to be undoable.
** Credits: A third party library called `CalendarFX` which can be found https://github.com/dlemmermann/CalendarFX[here] was used to implement this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: added an appointment list panel and individual appointment card for viewing the list of appointments stored using the `listAppointment` command.

=== Address Book Features

==== Person vs Celebrity: What's the difference?

In our application, Celebrities are meant to be the celebrities that you, the manager, are currently managing. The other people are each referred to as a Person. The way you create or edit a Person is almost exactly the same as a Celebrity. Both have the same necessary and optional fields to them such as a name, phone number, address, email and some descriptive tags. The only difference is that if you want to create a Celebrity instead of a regular Person in our app, you need to have a compulsory `celebrity` tag, in small letters. This will signal to the program that you want to create a Celebrity instead of a normal Person. In other words, the usage of `celebrity` as a tag is reserved for creation of Celebrities. In some of the commands which deal with the adding and editing of a person this will be further explained.

Each celebrity has their own calendar, which will displays the appointments he/she will be attending.

==== Adding a person: `add` [Since v1.0]

Adds a person to CelebManager. +
Alias: `a` +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags, including 0.

****
* You can add two types of persons to CelebManager: contacts and celebrities.
* Celebrities refer to the celebrities that you, the manager, are currently managing, while contacts refer to other persons.
* Contacts refer to contacts other than celebrities.
* If you want to add a celebrity to CelebManager, you need to tag him/her with `celebrity` tag.
Refer to examples below for more information.
* For each celebrity added, CelebManager creates a calendar in `CalendarPanel` for him/her. This calendar displays the appointments
he/she will be attending.
* CelebManager assumes that any celebrity added is a celebrity that you are managing. If you want to add an actual celebrity
who is not managed by you, you need to avoid using `celebrity` tag and find another tag name to indicate this information.
****

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` +
Adds a contact named `John Doe` to CelebManager.

* `add n/Betsy Crower t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal` +
Adds a contact named `Betsy Crower` to CelebManager.

* `add n/John Lennon p/91827364 e/johnlennon@example.com a/John Lennon Rd, Block 321, #03-04 t/celebrity t/singer` +
Adds a celebrity named `John Lennon` to CelebManager and creates an empty calendar named `John Lennon`.

* `add n/Paul McCartney p/91827364 e/paulmccartney@example.com a/Paul McCartney Rd, Block 789, #05-06 t/celebrity` +
Adds a celebrity named `Paul McCartney` to CelebManager and creates an empty calendar named `Paul McCartney`.

==== Editing a person : `edit` [Since v1.0]

Edits an existing person in CelebManager. +
Alias: `e` +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the last person listing.
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tag after it.
* If `celebrity` tag gets removed, the person's calendar will be removed and person will be removed from appointments
he/she will be attending. Removal of the calendar and person from appointments *is not undoable*.
* If the person now has `celebrity` tag, a calendar will be created for him/her.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Changes the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crowen t/` +
Changes the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crowen` and clears all existing tags.

* `edit 1 t/celebrity`
Converts the 1st person to a celebrity.
If you follow all the examples so far, a new calendar should be created for this person as shown below.

* `edit 3 n/Michael Jackson t/Singer`
Converts the 3rd person to a contact.
If you follow all the examples so far, this person's calendar should be deleted as shown below.


=== Appointment Features

==== Adding an appointment: `addAppointment` [Since v1.2]

Adds an appointment and shows the calendar of the start date of the added appointment. +

[NOTE]
====
To change the date displayed by the calendar in `CalendarPanel`,
refer to <<Changing the base date of calendar: `viewDate` [Since v1.5]>>.
====

Alias: `aa` +
Format: `addAppointment n/APPOINTMENT_NAME [l/LOCATION] [sd/START_DATE] [st/START_TIME] [ed/END_DATE] [et/END_TIME]
[c/CELEBRITY_INDEX]... [p/POINT_OF_person_INDEX]...`

****
* `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must be of the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, e.g. `03-07-2018`.
* `START_DATE` *must not be* after `END_DATE`.
* If `START_DATE` or `END_DATE` is omitted, it will take on the value of the current date.
* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` must be of the format `HH:MM` and 24-hour format is used, e.g. `14:05`.
* `START_TIME` *must be* at least 15 minutes before `END_TIME` if `START_DATE` is equal to `END_DATE`.
* If `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` are both omitted, `START_TIME` will take on the current time and `END_TIME` will be
15 minutes after `START_TIME`.
* If `START_TIME` is omitted while `END_TIME` is not, `START_TIME` will be 15 minutes before `END_TIME`.
* If `END_TIME` is omitted while `START_TIME` is not, `END_TIME` will be 15 minutes after `START_TIME`.

=== AddAppointment Feature
==== Current Implementation

The AddAppointment mechanism is facilitated by the `AddAppointmentCommand`, which resides inside `Logic`. It supports the adding of an appointment to an existing calendar.
The appointment, if added successfully, can be viewed in our `CalendarPanel` UI. This is done by retrieving the list of calendars stored in our `CalendarPanel`
and then adding the appointment to one or more of these calendars. This command extends `Command` so it *does not support the undo/redo feature*.

To be able to create appointments, add them to calendars and view the calendar with the added appointments, the external CalendarFX package is used. The API for all the CalendarFX classes and methods used can be found http://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/apidocs/index.html[here].

* For the calendar, the `CelebCalendar` class is used, which extends the default `Calendar` class from CalendarFX used to describe a calendar.

* For the appointment, the `Appointment` class is used, which is extended from `Entry`, the default class used to represent an entry in a `Calendar` in CalendarFX.

* All `CelebCalendar` instances reside in an instance of `CalendarSource`, the class used to store a group of calendars in CalendarFX.

* This instance of `CalendarSource` is atttached to our `CalendarView` which is the GUI for our calendar.

[NOTE]
Inheritance from the base classes of the external package is done so that we can add in additional methods as necessary.

Right now, the addAppointment command takes in up to 8 parameters. They are:

* Appointment name [Compulsory field]
* Location
* Start Date
* Start Time
* End Date
* End Time
* Celebrity Indices
* Point of Contact Indices

The `AddAppointmentCommandParser` is able to create sensible appointments even if 1 or more of the non-compulsory fields are not included. The snippet code below shows how the parsing is handled:

[source,java]
----
public AddAppointmentCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ArgumentMultimap argMultiMap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_START_TIME,
                PREFIX_START_DATE,  PREFIX_LOCATION, PREFIX_END_TIME, PREFIX_END_DATE, PREFIX_CELEBRITY,
                PREFIX_POINT_OF_CONTACT);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultiMap, PREFIX_NAME)
                || !argMultiMap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                    AddAppointmentCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        try {
            String appointmentName = ParserUtil.parseGeneralName(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
            Optional<LocalTime> startTimeInput = ParserUtil.parseTime(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_START_TIME));
            Optional<LocalDate> startDateInput = ParserUtil.parseDate(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_START_DATE));
            Optional<LocalTime> endTimeInput = ParserUtil.parseTime(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_END_TIME));
            Optional<LocalDate> endDateInput = ParserUtil.parseDate(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_END_DATE));
            Optional<MapAddress> locationInput = ParserUtil.parseMapAddress(argMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX_LOCATION));
            Set<Index> celebrityIndices = ParserUtil.parseIndices(argMultiMap.getAllValues(PREFIX_CELEBRITY));
            Set<Index> pointOfContactIndices = ParserUtil.parseIndices(argMultiMap.getAllValues(PREFIX_POINT_OF_CONTACT));

            MapAddress location = null;
            LocalTime startTime = LocalTime.now();
            LocalDate startDate = LocalDate.now();
            LocalTime endTime = LocalTime.now();
            LocalDate endDate = LocalDate.now();

            if (startTimeInput.isPresent()) {
                startTime = startTimeInput.get();
                endTime = startTimeInput.get();
            }
            if (endTimeInput.isPresent()) {
                endTime = endTimeInput.get();
            }
            if (startDateInput.isPresent()) {
                startDate = startDateInput.get();
                endDate = startDateInput.get();
            }
            if (endDateInput.isPresent()) {
                endDate = endDateInput.get();
            }
            if (locationInput.isPresent()) {
                location = locationInput.get();
            }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

The format for all the fields are located inside of `Appointment` and are as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class Appointment extends Entry {

    public static final String MESSAGE_NAME_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Appointment names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank"; // used for name and location

    public static final String MESSAGE_TIME_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Time should be a 2 digit number between 00 to 23 followed by a :"
            + " followed by a 2 digit number beetween 00 to 59. Some examples include "
            + "08:45, 13:45, 00:30";
    public static final String MESSAGE_DATE_CONSTRAINTS =
            "Date should be a 2 digit number between 01 to 31 followed by a -"
            + " followed by a 2 digit number between 01 to 12 followed by a -"
            + " followed by a 4 digit number describing a year. Some months might have less than 31 days."
            + " Some examples include: 13-12-2018, 02-05-2019, 28-02-2018";

    public static final DateTimeFormatter TIME_FORMAT = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("HH:mm");

    public static final DateTimeFormatter DATE_FORMAT = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-uuuu")
            .withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT); // prevent incorrect dates
    ...
}
----

The following sequence diagram (Figure 1) gives an overview of how the command works and interacts with the other components:

After input of `addAppointment n/Oscars 2018 st/18:00 sd/06-04-2018 l/Hollywood et/20:00 ed/06-04-2018 c/1`,
the added appointment will be reflected in the calendar as shown in the figure below (Figure 3):

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Ability to undo `addAppointment` command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Cannot be undone
** Pros: Needs not remember previous state of the storage calendar.
** Pros: If user made small mistake in one or more of the fields, can use `editAppointment` command instead of undo and re-add
the new appointment with the correct fields.
** If user instead just want to cancel the appointment, can use `deleteAppointment` command
** Cons: Cannot remove or edit additions made by mistake without looking at the list of appointments.
* **Alternative 2:** Can be undone
** Pros: Can remove additions made by mistake.
** Cons: Requires drastic change in the way calendars are currently saved and loaded, as calendars currently only stay
in UI component while appointments in Model component.
